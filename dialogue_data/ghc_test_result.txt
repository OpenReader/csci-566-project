i dont know what youre talking about

so all by yourself youre going to destroy every government in the world
i dont know what you mean

easier than that buddy ill get them to destroy each other you kill an entire peace conference someone is going to have to pay then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour london cairo beijing pretty soon everyones involved these guys bomb those guys those guys invade these guys soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days no rules no law everybody free to do what they want

im afraid without cerebros help he wont have the strength to heal himself  and without the neuro filter theres no cerebro
i dont know what youre talking about

its core
what do you mean by that

for what purpose
you know what i mean

yes  only theres a problem the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature its forcing the bodys cells to replicate thousands of times faster than theyre accustomed to the senators body is literally burning itself out scott  this machine kills people and i dont think magneto realizes it
because i dont want to talk about it

in the road to survival there is always sacrifice logan we are the future not them we must protect ourselves after tonight when the leaders of the world return home  they will return as brothers as mutants and our cause will be theirs this is survival i know you understand that logan or is it wolverine
i dont know i just dont know what to say

i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto
you know what i mean

the man who killed the guy who killed himself i killed him i killed him

deal
i dont know what you mean

this this whole god damn thing making yourselves into some sort of team of superpowered freaks teaching wayward mutants about classical literature for what
you know what i mean

what if it never happens what if theyre so afraid of us that we become the enemy  this place is gonna be one giant cemetery
what do you mean by that

no thats me talking and you know what its only been thirtytwo hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me

what did she do to me
i dont know i dont know what else to say i dont know what else to do

she borrowed your power to save her life when she touches someone she absorbs their strengths  their gifts in your case  your ability to heal thats why she keeps her body covered
she was a friend of mine

i felt like she almost killed me
i dont know what youre talking about
