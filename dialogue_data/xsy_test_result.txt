most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place . i expected you to do the same .
you want to do something .

that shows me already that you don t have a clue . what s it to you anyway ?
yes .

whether you thought this was for real or not you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . that tells me something about your character .
what ?

good for you . now why don t you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you didn t go through all this for my benefit .
you re not supposed to .

it s your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .
yes .

a fed i shoulda known . who else would have this kind of budget ? now you re gonna hit me with the sales pitch .
you re not supposed to .

alright cage you ve got me . this is one of those moments . many are called few are chosen that kind of thing . your government needs you . are you up for the challenge ?
no .

 . .if you re trolling around for narcs man have you got the wrong guy .
i m not talking about you .

why is that ?
i don t know .

look at me dude do i look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests you shoulda just asked me . i woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
what do you mean ?

oh i don t know i think the tests work pretty well . sometimes they give me answers you wouldn t admit to in a million years .
you were in the law of a fact .

are we done now ? you ve got nothing on me . so if you ain t booking me i m walking .
i m sorry .

you ve got this wrong . you re not under arrest you ve been abducted . and until i say different you belong to me .
i m not .

is that a fact ?
yes .

i m sorry .

you know what i hate ? any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they re god .
what ?

congratulations you ve just graduated at the head of your class .
i m sorry .

you re a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there .
i don t know .

you ve really got me confused cage . on the one hand you showed leadership courage under fire a willingness to protect men you hardly knew . . . and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic . help me out here . i m not following your evolution .
you re not .

you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gimme a break . you re not interested in my past you re interested in my future as some kind of spy .
i m not .

you re perceptive too . i forgot to add that to the list of surprises . i m with the national security agency . and unlikely as it may sound i need your help .
i m not .

i m not interested . i ve already got a job .
i m not wasting my life .

you re an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you re not getting any younger .
i m not wasting my ass .

i plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .
i don t want to .

now i m the one who s nauseous . so what s the deal ? what do you need me for ?
i m not sure .

there s some folks i want to keep tabs on . dirty tattooed uncivilized . your kind of people .
what ?

what do i get out of it ?
you want to do it ?

if you find out what i want to know and if i m able to successfully use that information you get to go back to your degenerate little life . if not you take a bath .
i ll be right back .

not bad for a gimp .
what s that ?

how about a pedicure as long as you re down there . what s this ? lo jack ?
i don t know .

wherever you go on the planet i ll find you . there s no quitting . if you try to take it off a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ?
yes .

i expect you to call in regularly with progress reports .
i ll take it .

up yours .
i m not wasting my ass .

is that all ?
he s not here .

i guess you got my e mail . i set up a purchase . ten cars .
you don t have to do that .

if you re trying to push my buttons you re on the right track . don t make me question my own judgment x .
you re welcome .

buddy you sent me here to get close to their organization that costs money .
what ?

one point two million dollars ? i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars !
i don t know !

i m already on a first name basis with these dudes i got a deal set up you want me to hammer it or not ?
i m not sure .

we re not after car thieves here .
you re not supposed to .

what the hell am i after ? you re telling me dick .
you re not supposed to .

that information is classified . you re there to gather information on their operations period .
you re not supposed to .

call me crazy but i thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side . what else ? you gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too ?
no .

my friend if you re planning on crossing me . . .
i m not sure .

you did say ahab ? you re sure about that ?
i m sure .

yeah i sent you pictures . here s what i m thinking . if they take out the cameras and sensors they could probably put a bomb in this thing . you drop it in the water in the red sea and three weeks later it s swimming up the potomac .
oh yeah ?

this is good work x damn fine work . you need to press on at all costs find out what they have planned with this ahab .
i don t know .

hey one miracle at a time . they re on to me now remember ?
yeah .

thanks .
you re welcome .

you re a grungy little phoenix you know that ? keep up the good work .
it s a good thing .

snow covered fortress . army of bad guys . the usual .
i ll be there .

i m on the way with a team to relieve you . what s the latest ?
what ?

they retrofitted ahab with some kind of rocket launcher . they were loading canisters of liquid into it light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate . something tells me this it that classified stuff you didn t want me to know about . does the song silent night mean anything to you ?
i don t know .

yes it does .
you re not supposed to .

come on gibbons you can do better then that .
i m not sure .

silent night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent . the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated . the black and white chemicals mix forming a toxic cloud . when it settles down to earth it ll kill everything in the vicinity .
you have to get out of here .

jesus christ gibbons this is something we came up with ?
no .

yeah that s right . so now that you know you understand why it s important that we get it back .
we ll get some towels .

kinda funny though isn t it ? we re not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules .
it s not fair .

somebody else makes those decisions not guys like you and me . you ve done your job x head back to prague . i ll be landing in minutes . this is my operation now .
yes .

thought you bought the farm down there x . glad as hell to see you .
i ll be there .

i m pretty happy to see me too . so are you done with me yet ?
i m not sure .

you ve kept up your end of the bargain i ll do the same . but you really should consider staying on you make a decent agent .
i am not a good man .

but i hate cops remember ? except for her .
i don t want to talk about it .

cut the crap x i saw you down there . you re a hero . don t be afraid to join the good guys .
you have to be kidding .

you know what they say the only way to change the system is from the inside .
what ?

oh yeah ? why don t we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? the poison needles ?
it s not really the best .

on come on x . did you really think we were that barbaric ?
no .

no needles huh ? what about the acid bath ?
yes .

all for show . just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing .
what s that ?

what do you have ?
i m talking about you .

not a whole helluva lot . his final transmission was mangled . about something or someone called ahab . whatever it is it cost him his life .
but you don t .

he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost .
you re a liar .

they re ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it s only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent night . then we re gonna have a catastrophe on our hands .
what s wrong with you ?

silent night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
i ll be right in the house .

we re gonna have to step in sam . those cia boys couldn t find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it .
you don t have to do that .

how will you fix it ?
i don t know .

i ll go in with a team . but first i m going to need some intel . i ll have to put someone inside someone new someone they won t see coming . one of their own .
no . . .

so you ll dredge the bottom again . you ve done that before . the results were . . . uneven .
i ll be there .

the usual prospects . convicts contract killers murde . . .
the other thing . . . ?

the scum of the earth .
the beach ?

but programmable . and expendable .
i ll get you the other way .

they re degenerates . there s not a man in there that would give a damn if the chinese took over .
what s wrong ?

ridiculous . cut him off . i m sorry gibbons you pulled up a shark this time .
it s not fair .

i think we should send him whatever he wants .
you don t know ?

you what ? a wire transfer of this size ?
it s a simple question .

if it means getting silent night back absolutely .
i ll get you some coffee .

you re talking about a very expensive risk here .
that s right .

he s gotten closer in hours than all of the other operatives combined . he got us an account number to boot . now even if he s just dumb and lucky i say we back his play . i put him out there sam . if he doesn t come up with the money they ll kill him . i can t let that happen .
what ?

alright do what you want . but keep the screws on him . he s a wild card . that could be either good or bad .
you don t have to .

whatchu doing here ?
here . . . ?

oh i don t know . it was an accident .
and you were in the house ?

we seen this kind of parachutes before you know . u .s . army . you got some friends here jump out with you guys ?
i m doing this for us .

we re on to the game ese . you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls you got your torture tools . . . it s all very cute . but come on let s quit while you re ahead . i m only trying to save you a beatin .
i m not wasting my life .

you saving me ? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling .
you re not .

alright . you wanna eat through a tube be my guest .
good .

what game is that ?
i don t know .

slick graphics huh ? see these dudes ? they re called anarchy they re the bad guy bosses .
you got it .

do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers .
i don t know .

next we got a siberian redneck viktor . into snowmobiles and snowboarding . so naturally he covers prostitution and the drug trade .
i ll get it .

this guy s kinda dorky lookin .
oh .

yorgi masterminded the take over of three red mafiya clans . cops called it blood week . he combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate anarchy .
you know what i mean .

 anarchy ?
no .

what are you gonna do ? they re euro trash .
they re not gonna hurt us .

just about anything i want it looks like . this is gonna be tough though . there s no way to save this game . i gotta get it right the first time through .
it s not fair .

what do you get if you finish ?
i want to talk about you .

nothing really . my guy is just doing it to stay alive .
that s what i mean .

oh . i bet by the end he gets something out of it .
what is it ?

like what ?
like you like it .

ten is hardly worth the effort . we re talking a lousy million five u .s .
i don t know .

do you know what a wire transfer is ?
what ?

is she for real ? honey maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .
i m sorry .

my goodness a word with four syllables . i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot .
what s that ?

sure . just chisel some off your heart .
i ll take it .

if you got a problem with me why are we dancing ?
i m not sure .

yorgi asked me to .
you want to go alone ?

you do everything yorgi says ?
i m fine .

go to hell .
what s wrong ?

it s gonna be like that huh ? you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else . why s that ?
yes .

mind your business .
this is my mother .

where are you going ?
i m going to get my car .

why are you still hanging around ? your business is finished you should go home .
i m not talking .

i was invited . what s your story ?
i m not sure .

come on don t front like that . you ll put a guy right off you .
i ll get you some other things .

don t even bother x man i m not your type .
i won t .

who are you ?
i m the owner .

we hung out last night remember ?
you don t know ?

i also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake i will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ?
i m not sure .

bullshit . i see you look at everything study everything ask questions . i know exactly what you re doing . empty your pockets .
i know .

hey you re good .
yeah .

maybe we should start again yes ? i know so little about you except that you re not what you say you are .
i m not .

i don t know what you re talking about .
you don t know .

the eyes don t lie . all this has gotten to you hasn t it petra ? you came in as yorgi s girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun . now you don t like it so much but you re in so deep you can t get out anymore . tell me if i m wrong petra .
you re not supposed to .

i ll get you a minute .

what are you ?
i m thirsty .

that s how you eat ? it s like a gerbil .
i m not wasting my life .

i m from l .a .
you re not going to scare me !

so why don t you tell me something about who you gather information for . they obviously have very deep pockets . are you from a rival clan ?
i m not sure .

let s just say i m freelancing and leave it at that .
what s that ?

whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don t say much .
what ?

don t judge a comic book by it s cover .
you ll never get away from me .

you agree with a lot of what he says don t you .
i don t .

i know where he s coming from . the only thing i really don t get is why he dumped you . up until i found that out i thought his judgment was pretty sound .
i ll see you in church .

don t even start . i ll be honest i don t trust you . bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true that i want to leave . what can you do about it ?
i ll do it .

the people i know want facts the kinds of things an insider would know . they re interested in putting anarchy out of business .
you re a liar .

all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .
i ll get you some things .

we could work together . then maybe we could both get the hell out of here . there s a beach in bora bora with my name on it .
you re not supposed to .

a beach named x ? that i d like to see .
that s right .

they tell me you re an american agent .
they re not supposed to .

what are you talking about ?
i m talking about you .

there s no more time for games . they made you . there s a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye . tell me if it s true .
what s wrong ?

it s a long story but yeah more or less .
i m not wasting my life .

jesus christ . you re going to have to go out the back . the data that you copied with your toy . tomorrow at six o clock . look it up . we re taking a trip . be there at six and you ll have plenty to tell your people .
i don t want to .

if i go out the back he ll know you ve warned me .
you don t ?

that s alright i ll figure something out .
what s that ?

i can t let this happen . i want you to go out the back . i ll make up some excuse .
you can t .

so what s the plan with this ahab ? are they selling it or what ?
the air . . . the bodies .

no something worse . he says it s a surprise but i know him . this is his masterpiece .
no .

we ve got to find out what it is . can you handle that ?
i m not sure .

there s something i didn t have time to tell you before .

i ll take a look at this .

no i guess i ve been no help at all to you .
you don t want to .

get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here .
what s that ?

of course . i ll do what i can . i have to go before they notice .
how about you ?

what s that ?

we ll have to go after them .
you don t . . . ?

aren t you afraid ?
what ?

a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that s my problem . if you don t feel fear you can do some amazing things but you can also screw your life up in ways you can t imagine .
i can t .

i must be healthy then because i m scared to death . i guess i d better get back to yorgi .
no you don t .

you don t have to do that .
i don t know .

yes i do . you re right . i can t just let him go free . besides i can help you from the inside .
i m not talking about you .

aren t they gonna wonder were you ve been ?
what are you talking about ?

i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they ll believe me . i ve been lying for so long one more time won t hurt .
i m sorry .

you can t talk to it ?
i don t know .

no it s like a safety . we are going to have to access the manual controls .
no .

it s running three meters down . twenty knots .
what ?

it has to surface to release the nerve agent right ?
i m not sure .

by then it s too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !
what is it ?

i can t believe my mission is finally over . i don t even know what to do with myself .
you don t have to do that .

what are you doing ?
i m thirsty .

nothing . he had two days .

you ll be fine .

from the beastie boys collection ?
the other guy .

it s a stakeout suit . it s got food water recording gear anything you need for covert spying . it s all weather fire retardant and if you give this buckle a sharp pull the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .
it s not fair !

now that i ve given you the overview we re going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail .
i ll be there .

hey you don t need all this just to go on vacation . unless this ain t for going on vacation . . .
i m not wasting here for this .

i m through xander .
you re not .

i can see that . why ?
i m going to the store .

you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert you break bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs all with no health insurance . . . it s insane i can t take it anymore .
i ll be right back .

i m having fun what s the problem ?
i m not talking about it .

you have all this talent and you waste it . you won t take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no you ve got too much integrity for that .
i don t know .

french polynesia ? this wouldn t last us a week in a cheap hotel . do you know how expensive it is down there ?
i m not sure .

you re a good customer .

this pizda ? never seen him before .
i don t know .

cops . like a plague . no matter how many you pay there s always another with his hand out . how did you pick him out ?

he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink .
he s dead .

thanks but i m here on business . i heard you re the g around here . i m looking for some cars expensive ones . a lot of them .
i m sorry .

sorry man don t know what you re talking about .
i m not talking about anything .

i remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour .
you re not supposed to .

we seen all your shit ! so you want cars ? we get whatever cars you need . what are you looking for ?
my name is emmett .

don t look at me x she handles all the details .
i won t .

very nice . i m impressed .
yes .

i had to inspect the merchandise first .
you re not supposed to .

what s this ?
it s a secret .

what s going on my friend ?
you re not talking about anything .

you tell me ! you got a sniper up there or what ?
what ?

he s not with us xander . he must be with you .
he s not here .

i don t believe it ! you can t shoot a cop in the middle of the street !
you should have known that .

total chaos man ! welcome to anarchy !
you don t want to scare him .

what s anarchy ?
i m talking about you .

it s all this craziness ! it s what we ve been living since when we left the army . one of our brothers died in grozny and we said the hell with this shit . what for ? he dies for what ? politics ? who s politics ? not ours .
who ?

screw the world . if i m gonna die for something it better be bitches and money .
what s wrong ?

to us it means no walls no speed limits no jails . it s everybody does what he wants . people think democracy is freedom but they don t have a clue . there s an old punk song . it says america stands for freedom but if you think you re free . . . 
to the hell i m not .

 . . .try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese . anarchy burger by the vandals .
you re not supposed to .

you got it man . it s stupid but it s true . true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want . that s when you know you re living man .
i m not .

how you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere ?
i don t know .

you got a great set up here yorgi . you really know how to live .
i don t know .

it s a beautiful town prague . it s been good to me .
you think i m not supposed to ?

i ve been here before when i was a kid . my old man was in the service we used to live on the army base in hamburg .
you re not supposed to .

you an army brat ? i don t see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?
not at all .

hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit so he was sure he d get his name cleared but it didn t happen .
what about the chairs ?

connections and politics it s the same everywhere .
it s not the best .

i ve got meetings this afternoon i ve got to get some sleep . just pick a girl .
you can t .

that s alright i m kinda tired .
you re a good saloon aren t you ?

that was for anders .
you re a liar .

and you . why do you have such a problem staying away my friend ? did you miss us that much ?
i m not sure .

i wanted to get the hell out of prague before silent night falls .
what s wrong with you ?

what s the gimmick yorgi ? that s the part i don t get . you gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs ? i didn t think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche .
what ?

you think i m after money ? i told you my friend . anarchy . time for a change . money is good but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .
it s not fair .

so all by yourself you re going to destroy every government in the world .
i ll get it .

easier than that buddy . i ll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire peace conference someone is going to have to pay . then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . london cairo beijing . . . pretty soon everyone s involved . these guys bomb those guys those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days . no rules no law everybody free to do what they want .
i don t know .

including rape pillage murder .
there s a way on the table .

sure if that s what you want . why not ? it s all human nature . so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it .
i ll take it .

and here i thought anarchy was just something cool to put on a tshirt .
yes .

you both could have been a part of it . you could have ridden with us into a new day the dawning of a new age of 
i think i should have a drink .

what does that mean ?
it s a good idea .

thomas edison knew how to make the light bulb . he had the energy source . he had the vacuum . but he didn t have the filament . he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power .
i ll take it .

i wish i could go .
you do ?

we all do .
i m sorry .

storm . try to look for the highest vantage point . from what i can figure he ll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island . it is my feeling that magneto has to 
no .

can the professor repair his own mind ?
no .

it appears as though magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings . and he is using adamantium as its core .
it s a romantic .

correct . . . apparently adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces . he used the adamantium in logan s dog tag to test it on the senator . and i assume now he plans to use the rest of logan s skeleton for a larger demonstration .
and you have a boyfriend ?

for what purpose ?
for the old bomb .

yes only there s a problem . the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature . it s forcing the body s cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they re accustomed to . the senator s body is literally burning itself out . scott this machine kills people and i don t think magneto realizes it .
you re not supposed to .

scott . . i 
i m not sure .

i don t like him being here .
i ll get you some other thing .

what are you talking about ?
i m talking about you .

you saw what happened tonight . you think magneto won t come after him again . you think he won t come here if necessary . this is a school for god s sake .
what s that ?

what s wrong with him ?
he s not here .

he s already losing control of his vitals . respiratory . cardiovascular . unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning i m afraid .
i m sorry .

are you all right ?
yes .

hey . i m sorry . about logan . i was jealous .
what s that ?

well i think that s perfectly understandable .
you don t want to know .

i ll tell you one thing though .
what s that ?

what s that ?
i m going to get it .

radar stealth mode checks out . all right there ll be less security north of the george washington bridge . i m taking her down .
i ll take her down .

into the hudson ?
yes .

i m going to assume that means that the secret service is out of commission . jean can you raise me up there ?
i m talking about you .

it s too far .
what s that ?

jean . . . can you ?
no .

inspiring now what am i doing here ?
i m going to get you in the room .

how long have you been in alaska ?
about two years ago .

i ve served with men like you before . methodical . systematic naive . you know what happens to those men in a real fight ?
i don t know .

you know you 
i m not talking about debbie .

i m o .k . i m o .k .
i m not sure .

anything else i can get you ?
no .

some cigars . case of beer .
i don t want to talk about it .

there s no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .
what ?

i won t light the cigars how about that ?
i ll get it .

i ll see what i can do you should get some sleep . even with your healing ability you re going to be hurting for a while .
i ll be right back .

the professor said you were a solider . actually i believe he used the word mercenary .
you re not supposed to .

yeah ? well i don t like to talk about my past .
oh you don t have any other choice .

maybe the professor could help you with that .
i m not sure .

by reading my thoughts ?
i don t know .

if necessary .
i m not wasting my ass .

you should always work with a spotter .
i don t know .

i was thinking maybe you and me could go into town .
i m not sure .

were you now ?
yes .

what do you say ?
i want to know .

let go .
suit yourself .

he s uptight .
good .

he takes his work seriously .
he s dead .

he takes himself seriously .
he s not here .

logan do you see this ring ?
i think so .

i ve seen a lot of rings .
i m sorry .

you re avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing ms . grey . three words are mutants dangerous ?
not yet .

ms . grey you work at a school for mutants in westchester new york . can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants ?
yeah .

math . history . science . english . athletics 
yeah .

you wouldn t happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to 
not at all .

this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus new jersey . a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . i don t know where you come from ms . grey but where i come from you don t go melting people s cars when they cut you off . you do it the old fashioned way you give em the finger . but what you presume to tell this committee 
i m sorry .

i presume nothing i am here to tell you that in time the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet . perhaps even your children senator .
i ll be there .

dr . grey .
you re a liar .

i m sorry to come here ms . grey . i was afraid if i went to a hospital they would . . .
i m not wasting my life .

treat you like a mutant ? we are not what you think . not all of us .
i m not wasting my life .

the mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change .
no .

you . . . wha . . . who are you . . . where is henry ?
no .

mr . guyrich has been dead for some time senator .
i don t want to scare them up .

whatever you do to me . . . no matter what you ll make me right . every word i have spoken will be confirmed .
what do you mean ?

the intention of registration act 
the hell i m not !

what is it you intend to do to me ?
i m not sure .

i do love a good check mate .
what do you want ?

what do you want ?
i want to know .

come with me and i ll let her live .
you want to go home ?

where am i ?
in the house .

what are you going to do ?
i m going to kill him .

what am i doing here ?
i m going to get you in your room .

i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto .
i m not .

who ?
the guy .

forty eight hours old man . but if you cross me i won t feel any guilt about what i do to you .
you want to go home ?

the point of what ?
of what ?

the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility . to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings .
what s that ?

now that s magneto talking .
it s not the best .

no . that s me talking . and you know what ? it s only been thirty two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me .
you sure ?

where are we going ?
to the hospital .

to find rogue .
to the airlift .

how ?
i don t know .

you designed this yourself ?
i m fine .

actually magneto helped me put it together .
it s okay .

he helped you ?
i m not sure .

i ve found her westchester mall .
you should .

don t you knock ?
i don t know .

they re all asking how you re doing . are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ?
i m not sure .

why ? you have a home here now if you want it . everyone will . . .
i m not sure .

why is everybody up at sunrise ?
i don t know .

the sun is setting logan . you ve been asleep for nineteen hours .
i m sorry .

what did she do to me ?
she s not here .

she borrowed your power to save her life . when she touches someone she absorbs their strengths their gifts . in your case your ability to heal . that s why she keeps her body covered .
she s a good girl .

i felt like she almost killed me .
she s not here .

if she held on any longer she could have .
she s dead .

i lost him .
you re not ?

how ?
i don t know .

is that what you re looking for ?
no .

a piece . only a piece .
i m sorry .

is it enough ?
it s not fair .

i ll find him .
don t you ?

i ll never understand your regard for them charles .
they won t .

and i ll never understand terrorists .
i ll get you some coffee .

i am trying to save our kind charles . you should do the same .
i m sorry .

the two in alaska . just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time ? still tinkering with cerebro ?
i ll get it .

is that so ?
yes .

still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves definitively .
i ll be right back .

you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me max . what is it like these days ?
not at all .

if i could make you understand . if you could just be made to see it the way i do . the way it s going to be .
you re not supposed to .

the way what is going to be ?
yes .

i m going to change the world with or without you as a witness charles . and this one gets a front row seat .
what s wrong ?

this checkmate goes to you . i didn t want to hurt anyone . but you leave me no choice .
i will .

i wouldn t really have let you die you know . i just needed . . .
i know .

doesn t it ever wake you in the middle of the night ? the feeling that some day some day very soon they will pass that foolish law or one just like it and they will come for you and your children ? take you all away ?
what do you mean ?

it does indeed max .
you have to .

and what do you do when you wake up to that ?
i m going to the business .

excuse me mr . waldman excuse me for interrupting . but is frederick then . . .a medical doctor ?
yes .

yes my dear he is .
you re not a good customer .

and has he achieved . . .any special degree of eminence ?
yes .

he is the fifth leading authority in his field .
he s dead .

oh shit .
what s wrong ?

frederick frankenstein ?
no .

you have the wrong house .
i m not .

and who might you be ?
i m not .

dr . frederick fronkonsteen .
you re a liar .

the grandson of victor fronkonsteen ?
of course .

no !
no !

what was your grandfather s name ?
iris .

forgive me for intruding so late at night herr baron . but an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle . these good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears . how say you ?
i m fine .

they say also that you have recreated the horrible monster who for so many years has haunted and terrorized the god fearing people of this village . what say you to that ?
yes .

i think we all need a good night s sleep . why don t we meet next week and thrash this thing out ?
i ll be there .

where did you get this cauliflower ?
it s a long time ago .

from your office sir .
you re a good girl .

didn t you prepare it with the celery before my lecture ?
no .

yes sir . but i must have taken the wrong one when we came up .

is that the best you have ?

yes sir . do you want the other cauliflower ?
i m not .

herr falkstein ! did you inform frederick frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place ?
i m not sure .

but i received a cable only this morning saying that he could not come .
but you can t .

was he aware of the importance of this occasion ?
yes .

yes sir he was . but he said he was obligated to lecture at johns hopkins university .
so you re going to be back ?

what lecture could be more important than the will of baron beaufort frankenstein ?
they re in the sub shape .

are you suggesting i call him master ? ? ?
yes .

no of course not . i just meant . . .
you re a liar .

poor delbruck ! there must be some way to reach him to control that body .
i don t know .

but there s a genius inside that body crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships . i just have to find some way to re establish his communications system .
i m not wasting my wife .

but you can t do that at night . and even if you could it would cost a fortune . come to bed darling .
i m not wasting my ass .

oh delbruck delbruck . was will dien tachlas von dir ?
i ll be right back .

you ve done everything that s humanly possible frederick . oh darling i m so worried about you you need rest .
i m not .

i suppose you re right .
you re not .

yes .

yes but . . . i thought perhaps tonight under the circumstances i might . . . stay here with you .
i ll be there for you .

i don t want to spoil anything i just want to top it all off .
you don t understand .

would you want me now like this so soon before our wedding ? . . . so near we can almost touch it ? or wait a little while longer when i can give myself without hesitation ? . . . when i can be totally and unashamedly yours ? ?
i don t know . . .

that s a tough choice .
you re a good loser .

is it worth taking a chance ?
i think it s not fair .

i suppose you re right .
you re not .

good night .
good night .

i hope you find this comfortable . this was baron victor s room .
you re not .

it seems fine .
it s not really the best .

you ll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas . . . all the rooms in your castle on this ring . i ll leave it on the table here .
it s not fair .

you mean . . . the laboratory ? ?
yes .

yes ! . . . the laboratory .
you re not ?

no ! dr . frankenstein always kept that separate .
it s not fair .

there seem to be quite a few books .
what s that ?

yes this was victor s . . . the baron s medical library .
i m not afraid of that .

i see . and where is my grandfather s private library ?
i ll see you in the morning .

i don t know what you mean sir .
i know .

well there was a public and a private library he said so in his will . these books are all very general any doctor might have them in his study .
i don t want to talk about it .

this is the only library i know of .
i know .

surely he kept his notes his private papers and records in some other place ?
no .

well . . . we ll see .
right .

will there be anything else ?
what do you think ?

i don t think so . is my assistant taken care of ?
i don t know .

i put her in the guest room just down the hall .
i ll take it .

how long will this whole thing take ?
i don t know .

a week . ten days at most .
i don t want to talk about it .

i don t understand . . .

you re a liar .

no it s dr . fronkonsteen !
it s not mine .

but aren t you the grandson of the famous dr . victor frankenstein ? . . . who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism ?
no .

i prefer by far to be remembered for my own small contributions to science . now if we can proceed to your questions .
you can t .

well sir . . . i m not sure i understand the distinction between reflexive and voluntary nerve impulses .
you re not going to eat it .

in conclusion . . . it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious because . . . once a nerve fibber is severed . . . there is no way to regenerate life back into it . are there any more questions before we leave ?
i don t know .

dr . fronkonsteen !
yes .

isn t it true that darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until by some extraordinary means it actually began to move with voluntary motion ?

a piece of what ?
of course .

vermicelli .
you re not going to be here .

but wasn t that the whole basis of your grandfathers work sir . . . ? the re animation of component parts ?
no .

my father was a sick man .
i m not afraid of that .

but aren t you the least bit curious about it doctor ? doesn t the secret of life hold any intrigue for you ?
no .

yes but sir . . . if it could be accomplished wouldn t that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death ?
i m not sure .

how old are you young man ?
i don t know .

nineteen sir .
what is it ?

nineteen ! my dear young man . . . once the human organism has ceased to function nature has deemed that creature to be dead .
what s wrong ?

but look at what s been done with hearts and kidneys !
what is it ?

hearts and kidneys are tinker toys ! i m talking about the central nervous system .
oh .

but sir . . .
