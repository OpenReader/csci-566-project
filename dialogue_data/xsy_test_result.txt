before you do that you might want to look at what i ve been looking at .
you re welcome .

the name s gibbons . you were saying ?
i m the owner .

what is this place ?
yes .

looks like a diner .
it s a mouse trap .

diner huh ? let me tell you what the problem is . i wake up drugged to find what ? you ve got a salesman over here reading a three week old newspaper . he s pulling a with a trucker who happens to be packing a cop issue h k mm . i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note . how s that for twisted logic ? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i walked in ? and if that s true why d they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money ? then i notice how beefy they both are . hell even the waitress is cut . all three of them look like they went through the same training program . ergo they ain t strangers and this isn t what it seems . that s how i knew yo yo wouldn t get a round off even if i gave him all day . why ?
i don t know .

that shows me already that you don t have a clue . what s it to you anyway ?
you want to do something .

whether you thought this was for real or not you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . that tells me something about your character .
yes .

good for you . now why don t you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you didn t go through all this for my benefit .
what ?

it s your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .
you re not supposed to .

a fed i shoulda known . who else would have this kind of budget ? now you re gonna hit me with the sales pitch .
yes .

alright cage you ve got me . this is one of those moments . many are called few are chosen that kind of thing . your government needs you . are you up for the challenge ?
you re not supposed to .

 . .if you re trolling around for narcs man have you got the wrong guy .
no .

why is that ?
i m not talking about you .

look at me dude do i look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests you shoulda just asked me . i woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
i don t know .

oh i don t know i think the tests work pretty well . sometimes they give me answers you wouldn t admit to in a million years .
what do you mean ?

are we done now ? you ve got nothing on me . so if you ain t booking me i m walking .
you were in the law of a fact .

you ve got this wrong . you re not under arrest you ve been abducted . and until i say different you belong to me .
i m sorry .

is that a fact ?
i m not .

sure as gravity . i ve had a feeling about you from the start cage . it s nausea .
yes .

you know what i hate ? any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they re god .
i m sorry .

you know what i hate ? it s always the assholes that pass the tests .
what ?

you re a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there .
i m sorry .

good thing you were there to save the day . come walk with me .
i don t know .

you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gimme a break . you re not interested in my past you re interested in my future as some kind of spy .
you re not .

you re perceptive too . i forgot to add that to the list of surprises . i m with the national security agency . and unlikely as it may sound i need your help .
i m not .

i m not interested . i ve already got a job .
i m not .

you re an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you re not getting any younger .
i m not wasting my life .

i plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .
i m not wasting my ass .

that s too bad . i thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge .
i don t want to .

there s some folks i want to keep tabs on . dirty tattooed uncivilized . your kind of people .
i m not sure .

what do i get out of it ?
what ?

if you find out what i want to know and if i m able to successfully use that information you get to go back to your degenerate little life . if not you take a bath .
you want to do it ?

you re one sick bastard . a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission . i think no matter which way i go i m likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic . so here s my answer kiss my ass hop along .
i ll be right back .

what s with that x on the back of your head ? does that mean you re extreme ? i ve got some news for you mr . x you re a three time loser . so maybe you should tattoo another couple of x s on your head .
what s that ?

wherever you go on the planet i ll find you . there s no quitting . if you try to take it off a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ?
i don t know .

yeah i spy or i die .
yes .

fine but i m not gonna be no bulldog omega .
i ll take it .

crude and defiant as always triple x . it fits so well because you re obscene .
i m not wasting my ass .

just remember i ll be watching .
he s not here .

if you re trying to push my buttons you re on the right track . don t make me question my own judgment x .
you don t have to do that .

buddy you sent me here to get close to their organization that costs money .
you re welcome .

one point two million dollars ? i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars !
what ?

i m already on a first name basis with these dudes i got a deal set up you want me to hammer it or not ?
i don t know !

we re not after car thieves here .
i m not sure .

what the hell am i after ? you re telling me dick .
you re not supposed to .

that information is classified . you re there to gather information on their operations period .
you re not supposed to .

call me crazy but i thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side . what else ? you gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too ?
you re not supposed to .

my friend if you re planning on crossing me . . .
no .

i know poison needles in my shins . you ve got hours . peace out .
i m not sure .

yeah i sent you pictures . here s what i m thinking . if they take out the cameras and sensors they could probably put a bomb in this thing . you drop it in the water in the red sea and three weeks later it s swimming up the potomac .
i m sure .

this is good work x damn fine work . you need to press on at all costs find out what they have planned with this ahab .
oh yeah ?

hey one miracle at a time . they re on to me now remember ?
i don t know .

i m gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you . just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives . and x ? you done yourself proud helping those people today .
yeah .

you re a grungy little phoenix you know that ? keep up the good work .
you re welcome .

you ain t seen nothing yet .
it s a good thing .

i m on the way with a team to relieve you . what s the latest ?
i ll be there .

they retrofitted ahab with some kind of rocket launcher . they were loading canisters of liquid into it light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate . something tells me this it that classified stuff you didn t want me to know about . does the song silent night mean anything to you ?
what ?

yes it does .
i don t know .

come on gibbons you can do better then that .
you re not supposed to .

silent night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent . the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated . the black and white chemicals mix forming a toxic cloud . when it settles down to earth it ll kill everything in the vicinity .
i m not sure .

jesus christ gibbons this is something we came up with ?
you have to get out of here .

yeah that s right . so now that you know you understand why it s important that we get it back .
no .

kinda funny though isn t it ? we re not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules .
we ll get some towels .

somebody else makes those decisions not guys like you and me . you ve done your job x head back to prague . i ll be landing in minutes . this is my operation now .
it s not fair .

we don t have that kinda time boss i don t think prague s gonna be around much longer . i ve gotta go now . i ve got a lot of bad guys to kill .
yes .

i m pretty happy to see me too . so are you done with me yet ?
i ll be there .

you ve kept up your end of the bargain i ll do the same . but you really should consider staying on you make a decent agent .
i m not sure .

but i hate cops remember ? except for her .
i am not a good man .

cut the crap x i saw you down there . you re a hero . don t be afraid to join the good guys .
i don t want to talk about it .

who says you re the good guys ?
you have to be kidding .

oh yeah ? why don t we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? the poison needles ?
what ?

on come on x . did you really think we were that barbaric ?
it s not really the best .

no needles huh ? what about the acid bath ?
no .

all for show . just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing .
yes .

you re a jerk off you know that ?
what s that ?

not a whole helluva lot . his final transmission was mangled . about something or someone called ahab . whatever it is it cost him his life .
i m talking about you .

he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost .
but you don t .

they re ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it s only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent night . then we re gonna have a catastrophe on our hands .
you re a liar .

silent night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
what s wrong with you ?

we re gonna have to step in sam . those cia boys couldn t find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it .
i ll be right in the house .

how will you fix it ?
you don t have to do that .

i ll go in with a team . but first i m going to need some intel . i ll have to put someone inside someone new someone they won t see coming . one of their own .
i don t know .

so you ll dredge the bottom again . you ve done that before . the results were . . . uneven .
no . . .

you wanna find out about rats ask a rat . i ve had my people put together a talent pool . i downloaded it to your desktop .
i ll be there .

the scum of the earth .
the other thing . . . ?

but programmable . and expendable .
the beach ?

i ve seen enough . turn it off .
i ll get you the other way .

that s exactly why we need them .
what s wrong ?

i think we should send him whatever he wants .
it s not fair .

you what ? a wire transfer of this size ?
you don t know ?

if it means getting silent night back absolutely .
it s a simple question .

you re talking about a very expensive risk here .
i ll get you some coffee .

he s gotten closer in hours than all of the other operatives combined . he got us an account number to boot . now even if he s just dumb and lucky i say we back his play . i put him out there sam . if he doesn t come up with the money they ll kill him . i can t let that happen .
that s right .

why not ? you were going to throw him in a tub full of acid weren t you ?
what ?

so the odds are up to fifty fifty ? i can deal with that .
you don t have to .

oh i don t know . it was an accident .
here . . . ?

that s some accident hombre . you accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard .
and you were in the house ?

we re anti social . we don t have any friends .
i m doing this for us .

you saving me ? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling .
i m not wasting my life .

alright . you wanna eat through a tube be my guest .
you re not .

now you re gonna make me enjoy this funny guy . now i m gonna take the whole foot off . whatchu think of that ?

what weapons do you have ?
they re not gonna hurt us .

what do you get if you finish ?
it s not fair .

i want to talk about you .

oh . i bet by the end he gets something out of it .
that s what i mean .

like what ?
what is it ?

he gets to be the hero .
like you like it .

whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don t say much .
what s that ?

don t judge a comic book by it s cover .
what ?

you agree with a lot of what he says don t you .
you ll never get away from me .

i know where he s coming from . the only thing i really don t get is why he dumped you . up until i found that out i thought his judgment was pretty sound .
i don t .

don t even start . i ll be honest i don t trust you . bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true that i want to leave . what can you do about it ?
i ll see you in church .

the people i know want facts the kinds of things an insider would know . they re interested in putting anarchy out of business .
i ll do it .

all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .

aren t you afraid ?
you don t . . . ?

a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that s my problem . if you don t feel fear you can do some amazing things but you can also screw your life up in ways you can t imagine .
what ?

i must be healthy then because i m scared to death . i guess i d better get back to yorgi .
i can t .

you don t have to do that .
no you don t .

yes i do . you re right . i can t just let him go free . besides i can help you from the inside .
i don t know .

aren t they gonna wonder were you ve been ?
i m not talking about you .

i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they ll believe me . i ve been lying for so long one more time won t hurt .
what are you talking about ?

when this is over we re just gonna take off the two of us . take a vacation .
i m sorry .

what the hell are we doing ? we re doing all this together trusting each other making plans and we haven t even slept together yet .
i ll take some of that .

he s a regular humanitarian . and all this time i thought he was just a tool .
i don t know .

let me guess they had a big white torpedo with them .
you re not going to scare me .

if they launch it i know how to bring it back .
yes .

let s do this .
you want to get along with you ?

he owns a big industrial complex on the river . he ll launch it from there .
he s in the bathroom .

i m going to the hospital .

you re right .

a piece of shrapnel hit me .
yeah .

i m sick of that guy . let s stop playing nice .
you have a boyfriend ?

you can t talk to it ?
you can t leave me in the car .

no it s like a safety . we are going to have to access the manual controls .
i don t know .

a manual control on a moving torpedo . this day keeps getting better and better .
no .

it has to surface to release the nerve agent right ?
what ?

by then it s too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !
i m not sure .

use your grenades ! maybe we can blow it up underwater !
what is it ?

you can t welch on me now . we had a deal .
you don t have to do that .

it s about your next mission . you need to be debriefed .
i m thirsty .

perhaps he is not all he says he is .
what did you say ?

it all happened so fast . such an unfortunate accident .
i m thirsty .

i d forgotten how exciting it is working together .
you know what i mean .

you ve been so quiet lately petra i thought you no longer cared .
it s a long time .

why don t we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline .
you have a lot of rings .

viktor ! stay the course .
you re not supposed to .

nice place to start don t you think ?
the other thing . . . ?

that s would be me .
i don t want to talk about it .

i stole your beat huh ? guess you forgot to brown nose the right people .
i m not talking about this .

is that supposed to be funny ? i m not laughing . i ve worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent funny boy . and ar the last minute i get bumped by you some reject from the ozzfest .
i ll do it .

why don t you show me some gear before you get hurt .
i m not talking to you .

listen to you . right away sir anything you say sir .
i don t know .

they come in any other styles or colors ?
i ll get it .

that one i m real familiar with .
i m not wasting my ass .

think again that s government property . you have to sign for everything . i ve got one more that wasn t on your list .
you ll be fine .

it s a stakeout suit . it s got food water recording gear anything you need for covert spying . it s all weather fire retardant and if you give this buckle a sharp pull the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .
the other guy .

you re joking right ?
it s not fair !

i thought that was in detail .
i ll be there .

i m through xander .
i m not wasting here for this .

i can see that . why ?
you re not .

you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert you break bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs all with no health insurance . . . it s insane i can t take it anymore .
i m going to the store .

i m having fun what s the problem ?
i ll be right back .

you have all this talent and you waste it . you won t take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no you ve got too much integrity for that .
i m not talking about it .

i don t wanna go mersh you know that . but hey if this is about money . . .
i don t know .

alright so i ll get more .
i m not sure .

it s not about the money x ! you never plan for anything . i can t live like that anymore i need some stability .
you want to go with you ?

well if you re bailing i guess i d better give you your surprise now .
it s not fair .

i was gonna wait till the islands but . . .
what s that ?

you re serious ?
oh . . .

of course i m serious . i bought it didn t i ?
yeah .

this is so typical . i can t believe you . i ve barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? are you out of your mind ?
it s not too bad .

i don t know . i thought this is what you wanted . you want stability here it is .
i m not sure .

you can t just propose to me out of nowhere . you think that s going to solve our problems ? i m sorry x . it was a kick for a while but it s over . you re just not going anywhere .
you ll be fine .

you re not exactly going anywhere yourself .
i know .

you re wrong about that . i m heading out that door right now .
i don t know .

i ve been on a plane for twelve hours i think i ll stand .
where is she ?

here we go again .
i m not wasting my life .

you re here because your government is putting pressure on my government . this is an internal affair a czech affair that you are interfering with . i will warn you once don t shit in my lawn . get whatever information your government seeks and get our .
you re not gonna hurt me .

first of all you should kill whoever sold you that suit . two i don t wanna be here either so just step off . three if you had the authority to shoot me you would ve done it by now so just ease up on the machismo bitch . now that we ve got that sorted out i m gonna get some rest .
i m not talking about anything .

the corner . anarchy .
thank you .

yeah thanks a lot .
i ll be right back .

you killed me remember ? now i have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?
i m thirsty .

is this what you re looking for ?
what ?

what s the deal ?
it s okay .

oh come on don t feel bad . you got played so what ? you re new at this . did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out ?
i m going to the hospital .

why you dogging me up ?
i m not sure .

they came and found me . they said they d kill me unless i help them . plus they offer me a lot of money . no big deal . these things happen . dump your gun on the floor .
i m not sure .

been to any good diners lately ?
i m thirsty .

a parachute . this does not argue well .
i m doing this for us .

he s a pretty good actor though .
it s me .

it s like you said every man for himself .
you re a good man .

looks like we re in the middle of the drug war .
what s wrong ?

this pizda ? never seen him before .
you re a good customer .

who you workin for ? what do you do for a living dickhead ?
i don t know .

he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink .
no .

i appreciate you bringing this to our attention . whatever you want the rest of the night consider it on the house .
he s dead .

sorry man don t know what you re talking about .
i m sorry .

i m talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in genoa and wind up here . if you don t know about em who does ?
i m not talking about anything .

when else are you gonna do it ?
you re not supposed to .

ferrari s lamborghini s . . . high end pasta rockets . ten to start .
my name is emmett .

it ll work faster if i have an account number .
i won t .

i m somewhat less so . we seem to have a bit of a problem . . .
yes .

of course .
you re not supposed to .

this is a gift . from me to you .
it s a secret .

you tell me ! you got a sniper up there or what ?
you re not talking about anything .

he s not with us xander . he must be with you .
what ?

bullshit ! you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god i m gonna give you another hole to breathe out of .
he s not here .

had to do what i had to do .
you should have known that .

what s anarchy ?
you don t want to scare him .

it s all this craziness ! it s what we ve been living since when we left the army . one of our brothers died in grozny and we said the hell with this shit . what for ? he dies for what ? politics ? who s politics ? not ours .
i m talking about you .

you wanna see my politics ?
who ?

that s what i m talking about man ! that s why anarchy was born .
what s wrong ?

 . . .try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese . anarchy burger by the vandals .
to the hell i m not .

you got it man . it s stupid but it s true . true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want . that s when you know you re living man .
you re not supposed to .

how you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere ?
i m not .

easy . you get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss .
i don t know .

it s a beautiful town prague . it s been good to me .
i don t know .

i ve been here before when i was a kid . my old man was in the service we used to live on the army base in hamburg .
you think i m not supposed to ?

you an army brat ? i don t see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?
you re not supposed to .

hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit so he was sure he d get his name cleared but it didn t happen .
not at all .

connections and politics it s the same everywhere .
what about the chairs ?

my old man he bought into the system and it screwed him . so he swallowed a bullet . me i don t believe in nothing i can t see and touch .
it s not the best .

that s alright i m kinda tired .
you can t .

you want to insult me ? this is my hospitality . pick one .
you re a good saloon aren t you ?

don t forget goatee boy . i greased him up on the diamond run .
you re a liar .

i wanted to get the hell out of prague before silent night falls .
i m not sure .

not bad man not bad . you put things together quick . prague it is .
what s wrong with you ?

you think i m after money ? i told you my friend . anarchy . time for a change . money is good but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .
what ?

so all by yourself you re going to destroy every government in the world .
it s not fair .

easier than that buddy . i ll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire peace conference someone is going to have to pay . then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . london cairo beijing . . . pretty soon everyone s involved . these guys bomb those guys those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days . no rules no law everybody free to do what they want .
i ll get it .

including rape pillage murder .
i don t know .

sure if that s what you want . why not ? it s all human nature . so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it .
there s a way on the table .

and here i thought anarchy was just something cool to put on a tshirt .
i ll take it .

come on xander . you used to stand for something . what happened to you man ? i thought you d get it .
yes .

oh just shoot us already . i m sorry i asked .
i think i should have a drink .

the neuro filter acts like a surge protector regulating the infinite flow of information from cerebro to the professor s mind . it s what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions .
it s a good idea .

 . . . until he found tungsten .
i ll take it .

we all do .
you do ?

storm . try to look for the highest vantage point . from what i can figure he ll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island . it is my feeling that magneto has to 
i m sorry .

beast .
no .

i m afraid without cerebro s help he won t have the strength to heal himself and without the neuro filter . . . there s no cerebro .
no .

its core ?
it s a romantic .

for what purpose ?
and you have a boyfriend ?

yes only there s a problem . the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature . it s forcing the body s cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they re accustomed to . the senator s body is literally burning itself out . scott this machine kills people and i don t think magneto realizes it .
for the old bomb .

so where do you think he s planning this larger demonstration ?
you re not supposed to .

i don t like him being here .
i m not sure .

what are you talking about ?
i ll get you some other thing .

you saw what happened tonight . you think magneto won t come after him again . you think he won t come here if necessary . this is a school for god s sake .
i m talking about you .

if magneto is planning to use logan for some terrible purpose it s our responsibility to do something .
what s that ?

his vital signs are weak and getting weaker .
he s not here .

we have to find magneto .
i m sorry .

no . i m . . . i don t know if we can do this without charles .
yes .

well i think that s perfectly understandable .
what s that ?

i ll tell you one thing though .
you don t want to know .

what s that ?
what s that ?

he calls me sport one more time and i ll blow a watermelon sized hole through him .
i m going to get it .

into the hudson ?
i ll take her down .

uh huh .
yes .

it s too far .
i m talking about you .

storm rogue you take the south entrance . jean and i will go in here .
what s that ?

i m sorry . i m not strong enough .
no .

i wanted to talk to you .
i m going to get you in the room .

i don t remember . is that what you wanted to ask me ?
about two years ago .

you know you 
i don t know .

shut up . i got no interest in you xavier or your . . . x men .
i m not talking about debbie .

sure you are sport .
i m not sure .

some cigars . case of beer .
no .

there s no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .
i don t want to talk about it .

i won t light the cigars how about that ?
what ?

i ll see what i can do you should get some sleep . even with your healing ability you re going to be hurting for a while .
i ll get it .

what if i like the pain ?
i ll be right back .

yeah ? well i don t like to talk about my past .
you re not supposed to .

maybe the professor could help you with that .
oh you don t have any other choice .

by reading my thoughts ?
i m not sure .

if necessary .
i don t know .

what if they re naughty ?
i m not wasting my ass .

he s busy right now .
i don t know .

were you now ?
i m not sure .

what do you say ?
yes .

not interested .
i want to know .

suit yourself .
suit yourself .

he takes his work seriously .
good .

he takes himself seriously .
he s dead .

what is it you re failing to get at ? are you interested in me ?
he s not here .

i ve seen a lot of rings .
i think so .

yeah i ll bet you have .
i m sorry .

i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded senator . the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous .
not yet .

math . history . science . english . athletics 
yeah .

you wouldn t happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to 
yeah .

control senator . . . we teach them control .
not at all .

i presume nothing i am here to tell you that in time the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet . perhaps even your children senator .
i m sorry .

i can assure you there is no such creature in my genes .
i ll be there .

senator ?
you re a liar .

treat you like a mutant ? we are not what you think . not all of us .
i m not wasting my life .

tell it to the ones that did this to me .
i m not wasting my life .

i can assure you there is no such creature in my genes .
no .

mr . guyrich has been dead for some time senator .
no .

you mutant bastards . . .
i don t want to scare them up .

gosh i hope so .
what do you mean ?

intention ? intention senator ? we are talking about mankind here . his fear . it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps . studied for weaknesses . and eventually wiped off the face of the earth .
the hell i m not !

let s just say god works too slowly .
i m not sure .

what do you want ?
what do you want ?

come with me and i ll let her live .
i want to know .

you think i care about her ? i m the only one who s sure to walk out of here .
you want to go home ?

you re backstage at the encore of creation .
in the house .

in the road to survival there is always sacrifice logan . we are the future . . . not them . we must protect ourselves . after tonight when the leaders of the world return home they will return as brothers as mutants . . . and our cause will be theirs . this is survival i know you understand that logan . . . or is it wolverine ?
i m going to kill him .

i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto .
i m going to get you in your room .

who ?
i m not .

a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you . i m not sure why but until we find out i must ask you to stay .
the guy .

deal .
you want to go home ?

this . this whole god damn thing . making yourselves into some sort of team of super powered freaks . teaching wayward mutants about classical literature . for what ?
of what ?

what if it never happens ? what if they re so afraid of us that we become the enemy ? this place is gonna be one giant cemetery .
what s that ?

no . that s me talking . and you know what ? it s only been thirty two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me .
it s not the best .

i believe he wants you for your adamantium .
you sure ?

to find rogue .
to the hospital .

how ?
to the airlift .

the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being .
i don t know .

actually magneto helped me put it together .
i m fine .

he helped you ?
it s okay .

we were friends once . . . but that was a long time ago .
i m not sure .

i ll go .
you should .

they re all asking how you re doing . are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ?
i don t know .

actually i m feeling up to leaving .
i m not sure .

what ? . . . miss me ? charley i m gonna walk out the front door and trust me it won t be soon enough for everyone here .
i m not sure .

the sun is setting logan . you ve been asleep for nineteen hours .
i don t know .

what did she do to me ?
i m sorry .

she borrowed your power to save her life . when she touches someone she absorbs their strengths their gifts . in your case your ability to heal . that s why she keeps her body covered .
she s not here .

i felt like she almost killed me .
she s a good girl .

if she held on any longer she could have .
she s not here .

and you think it helps calling her rogue ?
she s dead .

how ?
you re not ?

it was xavier s people . they knew .
i don t know .

a piece . only a piece .
no .

is it enough ?
i m sorry .

enough for a test .
it s not fair .

alive .
don t you ?

and i ll never understand terrorists .
they won t .

i am trying to save our kind charles . you should do the same .
i ll get you some coffee .

not at the cost of lives max .
i m sorry .

what do you want with him ?
i ll get it .

still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves definitively .
yes .

you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me max . what is it like these days ?
i ll be right back .

let s just say that i am out to make some radical changes . now come on charles . for old times sake for your sake . . . leave him to me .
not at all .

the way what is going to be ?
you re not supposed to .

i m going to change the world with or without you as a witness charles . and this one gets a front row seat .
yes .

what do you mean to do ?
what s wrong ?

what do you mean to do ?
i will .

i know .
i know .

it does indeed max .
what do you mean ?

and what do you do when you wake up to that ?
you have to .

i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble .
i m going to the business .

yes my dear he is .
yes .

and has he achieved . . .any special degree of eminence ?
you re not a good customer .

he is the fifth leading authority in his field .
yes .

oh shit .
he s dead .

herr falkstein you must go at once and present dr . frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance . the estate will provide for your journey .
what s wrong ?

you have the wrong house .
no .

and who might you be ?
i m not .

dr . frederick fronkonsteen .
i m not .

the grandson of victor fronkonsteen ?
you re a liar .

no !

what was your grandfather s name ?
no !

victor frankenstein .
iris .

so you re going to be back ?

here ! this cauliflower is useless to me .
the other thing ?

yes sir .
what s wrong ?

he has a big mouth . yes ! it seems to me i did read something about that incident as a student . but you have to remember that a worm with very few exceptions is not a human being .
you ve got to be kidding me .

yes sir ?
yes sir !

bring me some surgical gauze a little tape and some disinfectant .
you ve got a good idea .

yes sir . do you want the other cauliflower ?
is that the best you have ?

 . . . no !
i m not .

i did sir .
i m not sure .

was he aware of the importance of this occasion ?
but you can t .

yes sir he was . but he said he was obligated to lecture at johns hopkins university .
yes .

what lecture could be more important than the will of baron beaufort frankenstein ?
so you re going to be back ?

 functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull . 
they re in the sub shape .

yes sir .
i m not !

i have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed . . .and by god it shall be done !

yes .

oh darling ! don t let s spoil everything .
i ll be there for you .

would you want me now like this so soon before our wedding ? . . . so near we can almost touch it ? or wait a little while longer when i can give myself without hesitation ? . . . when i can be totally and unashamedly yours ? ?
you don t understand .

that s a tough choice .
i don t know . . .

is it worth taking a chance ?
you re a good loser .

i suppose you re right .
i think it s not fair .

of course i am . now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy .

well there was a public and a private library he said so in his will . these books are all very general any doctor might have them in his study .
i know .

this is the only library i know of .
i don t want to talk about it .

surely he kept his notes his private papers and records in some other place ?
i know .

i think you must be mistaken sir .
no .

will there be anything else ?
right .

i don t think so . is my assistant taken care of ?

no .

so you got it in the line of dooty . . . . . point taken .
you know what i mean .

could be . across the river into zululand . . they might just be waiting there for us to show up . . . .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies ! . . . .
you have to . . . ?

you afeared of the zulus then quartermaster ?
where is the key ?

one zulu is only one man . . . .and i m afeared of no one man . . . but the zulu they come in the thousands . . . . like a black wave of death . . . . in the thousands . . . . and them assegais . . . . stabbing !
yes .

zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don t mean to say they got no brains . they ll watch us and wait and find our weaknesses .
i don t know .

excuse me my lord . norris newman of the standard my lord .
i m sorry .

 saw you lead our cavalry sir
i m sorry .

indeedldid mylord . itwas one ofthe first to cross .
what ?

were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory ?
i ll get it .

they spurred onto high ground my lord full of spirit and looking for the zulu . full of sport they were my lord .
yes .

tell what you see . write it well sir and make sure you get it right
they re not supposed to .

if i ve got it right my lord you lead an invasion into zululand for i see it all around me but why ? is the question my readers will ask . why ? 
i m not sure .

do not confuse yourse fi why ? we must strike a heavy blow . this cannot be a war of manoeuvre .
i ll get your car .

so attack is your defence . well let s hope cetshwayo will offer his impis full destruction .
i don t know .

my only fear is that the zulu will avoid the engagement
you re a good customer .

eleven o clock my lorj 
i m not talking .

our friend colonel dumford will be should be at this minute approaching pulleine . i think we ll eat here . i want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour . .
i m sorry .

sikali horse my lord . christians all i know each one by name .
they are .

they come well recommended do they ? durnford
you don t know who it is .

i thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks zulu .
now what ?

my lord . this list was prepared for you . i don t think another can understand its true value .
i m not sure .

i have received intelligence from sources of my own that the zulu impis are moving north of here and threaten your left .
yes .

intelligence ? sources of your own ? did it not occur to you they may be native rumours ? rumours to draw you off to leave the whole ofnatal open to a possible counter thrust
i m not gonna hurt you .

i m explaining my reasons .
yes .

and the threat of counter invasion no longer exists ? 
you want to scare me some time ?

but will they make good use of them ?
i m not .

er called noggs sir actual name is norris newman . he presented credentials from the standard .
it s not the best .

our runners bare his dispatches do they not ?
you re a good loser .

thank you .
what s that ?

a large party of zulus have been sighted in the direction of the king s kraal getting up chelmsford moves over to look at the map on his desk .
you ve got to be kidding .

certainly sin
you re not supposed to .

yes .
i m not sure .

how quickly can you move your artillery forward ?
and you want to see him ?

well my horses are feeding as you may observe mr coghill . it ll take a little while .
i m fine .

well fed or hungry pulleine wants them in position immediately . .
i ll get some of that .

right . bombardier to me please .
you don t have any other choice .

um . there are rumours that my lord chelmsford intends to make durnford second in command .
you have to .

well that s typical of her majesty s army . appoint an engineer to do a soldier s work .
you re not supposed to .

which one ?
no .

well that one . the one who keeps looking at me .
the one .

ft could be you flatter yourself coghill it s that odd eye .
you re a good man .

keep steady . you re the best shots of the twenty fourth . you bunch of heathens do it
how about tomorrow ?

good ones yes mr vereker . gentlemen who can ride and shoot
i m waiting for the best .

i m to take the sikali with the main column to the river
i don t know .

lord chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my basutos .
i ll get the fucking way .

i think chelmsford wants a good man on the border why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady commander in reserve .
i ll get it .

and i assure you you do not in fact i d be obliged for your best advice . what have your scouts seen ?
you don t want to know .

so far only their scouts . but we have had reports of a small impi farther north over there .
i m not sure .
